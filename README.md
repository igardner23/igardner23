- 👋 Hi, I’m @igardner23
- 👀 I’m interested in... god so many things, that's really hard to answer, but also I'm trying to upload a project right now, so I should definitely get back to this later.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... I mean, I'm constantly learning, it's a lot.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... pretty much anything, I like collaborating and am always happy to help in any way that I can, I love puzzly things in particular
- 📫 How to reach me ... Email? I guess? Maybe like, if you message me on here? Who knows, depends on when you're asking. I'll fix this later.
